				<p class="lead">According to their website, Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money. 
					Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the 
					issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody 
					owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, 
					Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.

				<p> In a book by Ricky W. Griffin called 'Organizational Behavior: Managing People and Organizations', 
					people have a trait called 'Uncertainty Avoidance', also known as a 'Preference for Stability,' 
					which is the extent that people will feel threatened by the unknown and prefer to in clear and unambiguous situations. 
					People continue to invest in the dollar because it is seen as a well known, stable, currency.

				<p class = "lead" ><b> This chart by charts.bitcoin.com shows Bitcoin's price volatility. 
				</b></p>
				<p> The volatility makes accepting Bitcoin as a currency a big risk for business, as the Bitcoin they receive may not be worth the same tomorrow. This makes it hard to use Bitcoin as it was meant to be used, a currency, because many business don't even accept bitcoin as a form of currency.

					<p> https://coinidol.com/reddit-no-longer-accepts-bitcoin-payments/ Reddit, despite being one of the main hubs of discussion regarding cryptocurrency in https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/, has stopped accepting bitcoin, citing "...the upcoming Coinbase change, combined with some bugs around the Bitcoin payment option that were affecting purchases for certain users..." (Reddit admin @ emoney04) as the reason for the decision.
					</p>
					</br>
					<p> https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-no-longer-accepting-bitcoin-as-form-of-payment Microsoft, one of the largest tech companies in the world, is temporarily no longer accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. The reason is due to the “unstable state” of the cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system.
					</p>
					</br>
					<p> https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/01/11/major-cryptocurrency-conference-no-longer-accepting-bitcoin/ In an ironic twist, even a major cryptocurrency conference for Bitcoin has stopped receiving Bitcoin due to "network congestion and manual processing"

					<p class = "lead" ><b> This makes bitcoin, as of today, to become 'an unspendable currency', which defeats the whole point of using it in the first place. These events no doubt make it harder for people to invest in bitcoin, causing its price to drop drastically.

				<img src="{% static 'images\chart.png' %}" alt="effects of bitcoin" width="1080" height="457" style="float: center;">
				<p class="lead">The digiconomist.com website recently released this graph that gets the estimated energy 
					consumption that bitcoin mining does. This is because the more you mine, the more electricity you use. 
					This means that generating more bitcoins literally makes bitcoin a gigantic environmental hazard. 
					According to the data in the digiconomist site, Visa consumes less energy than Bitcoin overall, 
					despite Visa having over 10x the amount of transactions per day as compared to bitcoin.

				<h1 class="display-4">Does this spell the end for Bitcoin?</h1>
				<p class="lead">Not quite. A similar trend happened with the dotcom bubble in 
					America in the late 90's, as a result of the growing popularity of the internet.

				<img src="{% static 'images\dot-com-bubble.jpg' %}" alt="Graph for dot com" width="1080" height="457" style="float: center;">
				<p class = "lead" ><b>History repeates itself.</b></p>
				<p class="lead">The DotComBubble is the hyperinflation of Internet-based company stocks due to 
					its growing popularity at the time. As you can see, like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies 
					in the market, the stocks of these companies peaked at Y2K then the bubble burst, making the 
					market crashed. As of right now, the cryptocurrency market is at the same stage of a market crash, 
					and what follows is the stage of stabalization, where the price of bitcoin would stop falling and it's 
					value would increase at a steady rate that follows historical trends

				<h1 class="display-4">Conclusion</h1>
				<p class="lead">Not only bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies in general have been dropping in price recently. 
					There are many reasons for this, such as the volatily of the currencies as compared to more traditional 
					currencies and the environmental impacts mining has on the world, as well as the rising cost of entry to 
					begin mining. However, this does not mean that you should give up on bitcoin, because as soon as the market 
					stabilizes, bitcoin's decentralized nature and robust security through blockchain technology would make it a 
					fine alternative to traditional currency.
